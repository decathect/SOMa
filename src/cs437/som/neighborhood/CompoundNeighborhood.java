/**
 * Collects a series of neighborhood width functions to be used sequentially in
 * training a SOM.  This allows a SOM to be trained with a large, linearly
 * decreasing neighborhood width initially and, afterwards, the width function
 * can change to a exponentially decreasing function.  Any number of
 * combinations should be possible.
 *
 * Using neighborhood width functions in a CompoundNeighborhood is an exception
 * to the instructions given in the NeighborhoodWidthFunction interface
 * documentation:
 *
 * The NeighborhoodWidthFunction object should have its expected iterations
 * property set before it is added to a CompoundNeighborhood object.
 *
 * Once a NeighborhoodWidthFunction has been added to a CompoundNeighborhood
 * object, its ownership is passed to the CompoundNeighborhood object ad should
 * not be modified by the user afterward.
