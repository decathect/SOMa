/**
 * Neighborhood width strategy for self-organizing maps that decays the width
 * by the so called "Mexican Hat" function (also, the Ricker wavelet or
 * negative normalized second derivative of a Gaussian), centered at 0 and
 * parametrized by the standard deviation.
 *
 * <pre>
 * The exact behavior follows the formula:
 *      \frac{2}{\sqrt{3 \sigma} \pi^{\frac{1}{4}}}
 *      \cdot e^{\frac{-t^2}{2 \sigma^2}} \cdot (1 - \frac{t^2}{\sigma^2})
 *  where
 *      \sigma  is the standard deviation of the corresponding Gaussian
 *      e       is the base of the natural logarithm
 *      t       is the current iteration
