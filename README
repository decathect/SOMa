SOMa is a self-organizing map library for Java.

The aim of SOMa is to provide programmers with a comprehensive library for
using or exploring self-organizing maps.  A few basic SOMs are provided,
preconfigured for simple use, as well as a highly configurable version, which
provides detailed control over the map's operation.

Maps can be saved to plain text files in an easily readable format.

Javadoc is the best source for usage and help.

The name comes from _Brave_New_World_ by Aldous Huxley.  Hopefully, SOMa can
provide you with at least one restful weekend...
