SOMa is a self-organizing map library for Java.

About
The aim of SOMa is to provide programmers with a comprehensive library for
using or exploring self-organizing maps.  A few basic SOMs are provided,
preconfigured for simple use, as well as a highly configurable version, which
provides detailed control over the map's operation.

Maps can be saved to plain text files in an easily readable format.

Documentation
Javadoc is the best source for usage and help.  There are some demonstrations
of SOMa's use in the demo package, which may be useful to get an understanding
of its usage.

Building
SOMa includes an Ant build script.  Just open a terminal, navigate to the root
directory of the project and type "ant".

Why the name?
The name comes from _Brave_New_World_ by Aldous Huxley.  Hopefully, SOMa can
provide you with at least one restful weekend...
