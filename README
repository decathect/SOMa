SOMa is a self-organizing map library for Java.

About
The aim of SOMa is to provide programmers with a comprehensive library for
using or exploring self-organizing maps.  A few basic SOMs are provided,
preconfigured for simple use, as well as a highly configurable version, which
provides detailed control over the map's operation.

Maps can be saved to plain text files in an easily readable format and read back
in to a running application.

Documentation
Javadoc is the best source for usage and help and we have made an effort to
provide useful and complete javadoc.  There are some source demonstrations of
SOMa's use in the demo package, which may be useful to get an understanding of
its usage.

Building
SOMa includes an Ant build script.  The jdk.home property in the file
"soma.properties" should be changed to point to the building JDK's base
directory.  After that is done, running Ant will build a JAR file which will be
located in "out/artifacts/soma/" and will be named "soma.jar".

Why the name?
The name comes from "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley.  Hopefully, SOMa can
provide you with at least one restful weekend, and there ends the implications
of the name that we would like to adopt from the novel.

License
SOMa's license can be found in the file "LICENSE".  The lib/ directory contains
external libraries used to build or run SOMa and a copy of their licenses.
These include the 3-clause BSD license, which SOMa is released under, the
Apache-2.0 license and, in the case of JDOM, a version of the Apache license
version 1.1 modified to make use attribution optional.
